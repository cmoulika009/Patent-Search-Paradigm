Ball and elevated court sport ...

Abstract
A multiple player team sport, rules and equipment combining features of volleyball, dodge ball, hand ball and table tennis. Two player teams are positioned opposite one another with multiple elevated playing surfaces between them. A tennis ball sized spheroid having a leather cover and resilient inner core for bounce is initially served by one team from one of its elevated playing surfaces toward and onto the opposing team's playing surface. The defending team may then strike the ball with any part of the body to return it, or it may be passed from one teammate to another to set up a kill shot onto either the opposing teams playing surface or by attempting to strike one of the opposing team's players. When the ball is not successfully returned, the last team successfully striking the ball is awarded a point. During play the ball may only be struck by a player's hand or body. The elevated playing surfaces are at least two relatively long opposed tables with provisions allowing players to approach the center line to be in positions for a kill shot, including rounded corners and tapered shapes to provide suitably large strike areas for the ball to be played onto while not restricting the players' ability to move forward and attack the opposing court.
