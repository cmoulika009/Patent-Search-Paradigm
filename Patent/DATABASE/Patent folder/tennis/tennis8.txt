Abstract
Disclosed is a technique for auto-deploying an application from a mobile communication device to a host in a pervasive computing environment. The technique can detect and can select an available host around the mobile communication device. The technique can determine if the mobile communication device issues a request of auto-deploying a selected application into the available host. In response to the issued auto-deploying request, the selected application can be auto-deployed into the available host for execution.
