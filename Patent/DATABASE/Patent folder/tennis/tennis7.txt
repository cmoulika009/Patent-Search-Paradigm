Abstract
A sports racquet for impacting a game ball and for facilitating the opening of a cap on a bottle. The sports racquet includes a head portion and a handle portion. The handle portion has a proximal end and a distal end. The distal end is coupled to the head portion. The proximal end defines a recess, and includes a projection spaced apart from a fulcrum. The recess is sized to removably receive a portion of the cap. The projection is configured to catch a portion of an underside of the cap and the fulcrum is configured to bear against the top of the cap as one or both of the handle portion and the bottle serve as a lever for prying the cap off of the bottle.
