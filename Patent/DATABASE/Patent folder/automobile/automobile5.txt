AUTOMATED WEB CONFERENCE PRESENTATION QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ...

Abstract
A slide presentation file created by a web conference client device at an initial presentation quality using one version of an application is uploaded to a web conference server device that implements a state sharing mechanism for web conference slide presentation quality improvement during a web conference among a group of web conference client devices. The web conference server device is requested to begin rendering and distribution of presentation slides as part of the web conference among the group of web conference client devices using the state sharing mechanism. A rendered web conference presentation slide of the slide presentation file is received from the web conference server device. A determination is made that the rendered web conference presentation slide of the slide presentation file is rendered at a presentation quality different from the initial presentation quality of the uploaded slide presentation file.
