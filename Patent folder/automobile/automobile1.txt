DELIVERY CONTROL FOR EMAIL COMMUNICATED AMONG MULTIPLE END USER COMMUNICATION DEVICES... 

Abstract
An exemplary method is implemented by end-user communication devices for processing the receipt of an email wherein a received email comprises a digital packet having a header and a user data segment. The user data segment contains a user message and an acknowledgement command where the acknowledgement command conveys a request from an originating device to acknowledge receipt of the subject email. The received user message is prevented from being displayed on a screen of the first end-user communication device of content until input is entered authorizing a reply to the acknowledgement request. Upon receiving the authorization: a reply email with an acknowledgement is automatically generated by the first end-user communication device and transmitted to the originating device corresponding to the subject email; the content of the corresponding received user message is displayed on the screen of the first end-user communication device; and the first end-user communication device stores a read message indicator having a value that represents that the reply email was authorized and the content of the received email enabled to be displayed.

Claims


1. A method implemented by a first end-user communication device for processing the receipt of an email, the method comprising: receiving the email that comprises a digital packet having a header and a user data segment, the user data segment containing a user message and an acknowledgement command where the acknowledgement command conveys a request from an originating device to acknowledge receipt of the subject email; preventing the display on a screen of the first end-user communication device of content of the received user message until input on the first end-user communication device is entered authorizing a reply to the acknowledgement request; upon receiving the input authorizing the reply: automatically generating by the first end-user communication device and transmitting a reply email with an acknowledgement to the originating device corresponding to the subject email; enabling the display of the content of the corresponding received user message on the screen of the first end-user communication device; and storing in the first end-user communication device a read message indicator having a value that represents that the reply email was authorized and the content of the received email enabled to be displayed. 

2. The method of claim 1 further comprising: storing the user data segment in memory of the first end-user communication device, the user data segment including a first message identifier that is assigned to the associated user message by the originating device, the reply email to the originating device including a message identifier that is the same as the first message identifier. 

3. The method of claim 2 wherein the user of the first end-user communication device has an email account with an associated user email address from which user emails are accessed by the first end-user communication device and other end-user communication devices, the method further comprising: upon receiving the input authorizing the reply to the acknowledgement request, automatically generating by the first end-user communication device and transmitting another email addressed to the user's email address to which the received email from the originating device was addressed, the another email including a message identifier that is the same as the first message identifier and a read message indicator having a value that represents that display of the content of the received email from the originating device had been enabled to be viewed, whereby the other end-user communication devices are informed upon receipt of the another email that the other end-user communication devices should treat the acknowledgement request of the subject email from the originating device as having been satisfied. 

4. A method implemented by a second end-user communication device for processing an email received at an email account with an associated user email address from which the email was previously accessed by a first end-user communication device, the method implemented by the second end-user communication device comprising: receiving from said email account the received email originated by the originator device and another email originated by the first end-user communication device, the another email including a message identifier that is the same as a message identifier contained in the subject email and a read message indicator having a value that represents compliance with an acknowledge receipt request associated with the received email; updating a value of a first indicator associated with received email as stored in the second end-user communication device to reflect that the acknowledgement request has been satisfied, said updating being executed based on receipt of the another email; upon receiving a user input to read the contents of the subject email on the second end-user communication device following said updating, displaying the contents of the subject email without a requirement to provide an acknowledgement request to the originating device; whereby, without said updating, a user input to read the contents of the received email on the second end-user communication device would have required the user to comply with the acknowledgement request even though compliance with the acknowledgement request had been completed by the first end-user communication device. 

5. The method of claim 4 further comprising: storing a first user data segment, contained in the received email, in memory of the second end-user communication device, the user data segment including the message identifier that is assigned to the associated user message by the originating device; storing a second user data segment, contained in the another email, in memory of the second end-user communication device, the second user data segment including a message identifier that is the same as the message identifier of the first user data segment; searching stored user data segments of received emails to locate a received email with the same message identifier as the message identifier contained in the second user data segment; upon locating the received email with the same message identifier as contained in the another email, performing said updating step. 

6. A computer program product, comprising a computer usable tangible medium having a computer readable program code embodied therein, said computer readable program code adapted to be executed by an end-user communication device to implement a method for processing the receipt of an email by a first end-user communication device, the method comprising: receiving the email that comprises a digital packet having a header and a user data segment, the user data segment containing a user message and an acknowledgement command where the acknowledgement command conveys a request from an originating device to acknowledge receipt of the subject email; preventing the display on a screen of the first end-user communication device of content of the received user message until input on the first end-user communication device is entered authorizing a reply to the acknowledgement request; upon receiving the input authorizing the reply: automatically generating and transmitting a reply email with an acknowledgement to the originating device corresponding to the subject email; enabling the display of the content of the corresponding received user message on the screen of the first end-user communication device; and storing in the first end-user communication device a read message indicator having a value that represents that the reply email was authorized and the content of the received email enabled to be displayed. 

7. The computer program product of claim 6 further comprising: storing the user data segment in memory of the first end-user communication device, the user data segment including a first message identifier that is assigned to the associated user message by the originating device, the reply email to the originating device including a message identifier that is the same as the first message identifier.
