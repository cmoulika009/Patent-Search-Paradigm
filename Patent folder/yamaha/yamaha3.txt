Abstract
In three-dimensional modeling apparatus, an image obtaining section obtains image sets picked up by stereoscopic camera. A generating section generates three-dimensional models... A three-dimensional model selecting section selects a first three-dimensional model and a second three-dimensional model to be superimposed on the first three-dimensional model among generated three-dimensional models. A extracting section extracts first and second feature points from the selected first and second three-dimensional model. A feature-point selecting section selects feature points having a closer distance to stereoscopic camera from the extracted first and second feature points. A parameter obtaining section obtains a transformation parameter for transforming a coordinate of the second three-dimensional model into a coordinate system of the first three-dimensional model. A transforming section transforms the coordinate of the second three-dimensional model into the coordinate system of the first three-dimensional model. And a superimposing section superimposes the second three-dimensional model on the first three-dimensional model.
