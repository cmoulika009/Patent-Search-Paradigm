DEFINING AND MATCHING SEGMENTS ...

Abstract
Defining and matching segments is disclosed. In some embodiments, defining and matching segments includes receiving a user defined segment via a user interface input; and determining a matching effort (e.g., which can include a set of Geographic Positioning System (GPS) data) to the segment using a processor. In some embodiments, the data associated with the effort includes one or more of the following: heart rate, speed, time, and power. In some embodiments, defining and matching segments further includes storing data associated with the matching effort with the segment. In some embodiments, the user defined segment is based at least in part in uploaded GPS data. In some embodiments, the user defined segment is based at least in part on selected points on a map application.

Claims


1. A method, comprising: receiving a user defined segment via a user interface input; and determining a matching effort to the segment using a processor. 

2. The method of claim 1, wherein the effort includes a set of Geographic Positioning System (GPS) data. 

3. The method of claim 1, wherein data associated with the effort includes one or more of the following: heart rate, speed, time, and power. 

4. The method of claim 1, further comprising accessing data associated with the matching effort. 

5. The method of claim 1, further comprising storing data associated with the matching effort with the segment. 

6. The method of claim 1, wherein the user defined segment is based at least in part in uploaded Geographic Positioning System (GPS) data. 

7. The method of claim 1, wherein the user defined segment is based at least in part on selected points on a map application. 

8. The method of claim 1, further comprising aggregating associated data of a plurality of matching efforts. 

9. The method of claim 8, further comprising displaying at least a subset of the aggregated data in a table. 

10. The method of claim 1, further comprising determining overlapping segments. 

11. The method of claim 1, wherein determining a matching effort includes a first threshold of match for a loose match and a second threshold of match for a tight match. 

12. The method of claim 11, wherein the second threshold is higher than the first threshol
